# LolX-64
### Info 
A LolX-64 emulator for PC.

The LolX-64 is a PC/Video Game Console that I (Lollio64) designed.<br>
It's a PC inspired of the era of early 3D graphics, for example:<br>
**Nintendo 64**, **Sony PlayStation**, **Sega Saturn**, etc...<br>

Here are some theoretical specs I made for the system:<br>
- 64 Bit Processor, 1MHz
- Either a simple GPU or no GPU
- 8 to 16 MB of RAM, maybe expandable
Just note that I'm **NOT** an expert on PC specs.
